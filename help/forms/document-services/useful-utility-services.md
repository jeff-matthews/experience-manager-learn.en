# Useful utility services

This sample bundle provides useful utility services that can be used by an AEM Forms developer. The following services are available

```java
package aemformsutilityfunctions.core;
import java.util.Map;
import com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document;
public interface AemformsUtilities
{
public abstract com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document createDDXFromMapOfDocuments(Map<String, com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document> paramMap);
public abstract org.w3c.dom.Document w3cDocumentFromStrng(String xmlString);
public abstract com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document orgw3cDocumentToAEMFDDocument(org.w3c.dom.Document xmlDocument);
public abstract String saveDocumentInCrx(String jcrPath,String fileExtension, Document documentToSave);

}

```

The sample bundle can be [downloaded from here](assets/aemformsutilityfunctions.aemformsutilityfunctions.core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)

```java
 aemformsutilityfunctions.core.AemformsUtilities aemFormsUtilities = sling.getService(aemformsutilityfunctions.core.AemformsUtilities.class);
com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document xmlStringDoc = aemFormsUtilities.orgw3cDocumentToAEMFDDocument(aemFormsUtilities.w3cDocumentFromStrng("<data><fname>Girish</fname></data>"));
aemFormsUtilities.saveDocumentInCrx("/content/ocrfiles",".xml",xmlStringDoc);
```
